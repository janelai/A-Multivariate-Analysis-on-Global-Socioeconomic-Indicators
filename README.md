**Moving Forward:** Future analysis may include data from all countries. This will allow us to explore intra-regional variations and identify key drivers, such as policy differences and historical factors. Additional socioeconomic variables, including population growth, industrial structure, and income inequality, will be incorporated to provide a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to the observed trends. Statistical models will be used to predict the effects of changes in GDP or education spending on outcomes like R&D investment, foreign aid, and employment. These patterns reveal that there is no universal formula for success; the impact of education on economic growth varies widely across regions. Future initiatives must consider the unique contextual factors that shape each society's position.
